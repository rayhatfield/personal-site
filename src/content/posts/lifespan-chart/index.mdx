After reading “[This Terrifying Chart Helps Me Get Things Done](https://forge.medium.com/how-i-deal-with-procrastination-8d3ab5780251)” by [Eric Olszewski](https://twitter.com/hrdwrknvrstps) I decided to make this little lifespan chart.

Each block represents a week, each row a year. Filled blocks are behind me, unfilled ahead.
